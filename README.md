What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


   The problem I was solving for in this was understanding how to write vectors, hash tables, and binary trees for loading bids, etc. I approached the problem by looking at different references and seeking outside help from tutors to understand how to format the project. Data structures are very important to understand because it shows the best way to format your project. Some options are better to use than others. 
  There were many roadblocks that I had encountered while going through the activities. Most of which include learning and understanding how a vector works, how a binary tree works, etc. It did require a lot thinking, and it helped me to expand my growth in programming. Working on these programs has inspired me  to explore and understand vectors, hash tables, etc a lot better than before. Working on these programs has reformed my thinking in a theoretically way to help formulate programs.
